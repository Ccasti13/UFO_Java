## Overview of Analysis
Are we alone in the universe? For millennia, humans have turned to the sky to answer this question. Now, thanks to research generously funded by W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast and amateur ufologist, we can supplement our sky-searching with data analysis. Be Free Truth Seekers: https://github.com/Ccasti13/UFO_Java/blob/main/index.html
The team was presented with a webpage that would allow you Truth Seekers to filter, however to better search for Alien Visitors, we want to filter data with specifics such as  city, state, country, and sighting shape.

## Results
This new page will take inputs given to the criteria table shown below, and create a table for results.

Below is a trial search, when inputting the city of El Cajon, a table was created.



## Summary of Analysis
The major drawback to the page is the year search function. Many Truth Seekers will put in dates significant to themselves, and the page does not have a large enough database nor a ‘no results’ output as shown below. 

One recommendation for future webpage growth will be to include more data and create a failed output message such as “no results found” or to pull the closest data point to the query.

Another addition that can be made to the webpage was suggested by another team member, to include a submission page in which you Truth Seekers can submit sightings to boost the database.
